### TODOs/Improvement Suggestions

**Frontend**: _Easy_ - Improve the design of the survey list and cards (bar chart? last responded?)

**Backend**: _Easy_ - Allow users to delete surveys that have been created

**Frontend+Backend**: _Medium_ - Allow users to specify the "from" field

**Backend**: _Medium_ - Update Mailer for latest Sendgrid API

**Frontend**: _Medium_ - Allow clientside sorting of surveys

**Frontend+Backend**: _Hard_ - Add the ability to create distribution lists and select them from a dropdown rather than a string of emails

**Frontend+Backend**: _Very Hard_ - Allow surveys to be created in "draft mode" (e.g., save the survey and come back to it to edit or send later)
